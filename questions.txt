1. Sales Manager

1.1. Should we automate `collect and send PDC` somehow?
If yes what web interface we should provide for this?
Just a checkbox that marks the task as complete, or
may be we could input parcel tracking number?

2. CFO

Check approval conditions and write remarks combined into one task,
is it ok?

3. Sales coordinator

How can we check is equipment available in stock or not?
Is it automatic task, or it would be performed by sales coordinator?

4. Logictics

What the source of Equipment received event? Is it human task, or
we will be integrated with another system over API?
